### 📜 Description

This is an interactive data visualization and analysis project that allows users to explore climate trends.
It's a Flask-based data visualization application that allows users to upload tabular datasets and generate multiple interactive visualizations based on their questions. The app utilizes LangChain for an agentized Large Language Model (LMM) to analyze the dataset and suggest relevant visualizations.

### 💡 Key Features

- Upload any tabular dataset (CSV format).
- Ask questions about the dataset in natural language.
- Generate multiple visualizations dynamically.
- Uses LangChain, FAISS for vector retrieval, and Google Generative AI for insights.
- Supports multiple visualization types, including histograms, pie charts, correlation heatmaps, and line charts.
